# Project Name

## Overview

This project is a web application that uses FastAPI for the backend and Vue.js for the frontend. It is designed to provide a robust and scalable platform for [project purpose].

## Technologies Used

- **FastAPI**: A modern, fast (high-performance), web framework for building APIs with Python 3.6+ based on standard Python type hints.
- **Vue.js**: A progressive framework for building user interfaces. Vue is designed from the ground up to be incrementally adoptable.

## Features

- **Backend**: Built with FastAPI, providing a high-performance API with automatic interactive documentation.
- **Frontend**: Developed using Vue.js, offering a reactive and component-based architecture for building complex user interfaces.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.6+
- Node.js & npm

### Backend Setup (FastAPI)

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-repo/project-name.git
   cd project-name
   ```

2. Create a virtual environment and activate it:

   ```bash
   python -m venv env
   source env/bin/activate  # On Windows use `env\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. Install the required dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Run the FastAPI server:

   ```bash
   uvicorn app.main:app --reload
   ```

   The API will be available at `http://127.0.0.1:8000`.

### Frontend Setup (Vue.js)

1. Navigate to the `frontend` directory:

   ```bash
   cd frontend
   ```

2. Install the dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Run the Vue.js development server:

   ```bash
   npm run serve
   ```

   The frontend will be available at `http://localhost:8080`.

## Usage

1. Start the FastAPI server:

   ```bash
   uvicorn app.main:app --reload
   ```

2. Start the Vue.js development server:

   ```bash
   npm run serve
   ```

3. Open your browser and go to `http://localhost:8080` to access the application.
